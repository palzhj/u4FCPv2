# SiTCP

SiTCP is a IP for TCP/UDP/IP protocol implementation in FPGA with high transmission efficiency. It is written by [Dr. Tomohisa Uchida](https://doi.org/10.1109/TNS.2008.920264), distributed and managed by [Bee Beans Technologies Co., Ltd](https://www.bbtech.co.jp/en/products/sitcp-library/).

The ngc file is from [https://github.com/BeeBeansTechnologies/SiTCP_Netlist_for_Kintex7](https://github.com/BeeBeansTechnologies/SiTCP_Netlist_for_Kintex7). This ngc file from Kintex7 can be used for Kintex UltraScale and Kintex UltraScale Plus devices.

The edf file is converted from the ngc file by the Vivado TCL command `exec ngc2edif <file>.ngc <file>.edf`
